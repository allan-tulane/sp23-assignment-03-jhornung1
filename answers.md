- **b.**

Because the function is iteratie work and span recurrence relations are the same and they are both W(N) = W(n-1) + O(1) (replace W with S for span respectively). This recurrence relation has a big O notation of O(n), meaning that both work and span are linear.


- **d.**

If we look at the version of scan that was provided in class (it's in the notes), then we have a work recurrence relation of W(N) = W(n/2) + n, which (in big O notation) is O(n). Likewise, the recurrence relation for span is S(n) = S(n/2) + O(1) which is equal to O(log n)


- **f.**
